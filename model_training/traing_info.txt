We were set on training a deep neural network that would take in pitch and/or timbre as input and would classify genre.
We tested models that had no convolution layers, we tested models with convolution layers that only accepted timbre or 
pitch as input, and we also tested the number of segments that the model would take in. After this testing, we decided 
on a 40 segment model that had two convolution layers for timbre and pitch separately, which would then be combined and
processed through three dense layers. 

The training data used the
